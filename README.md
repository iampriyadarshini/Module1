Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
ðŸ§¾ Program
num=int(input())
if(num%2==0):
      print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
Output

Result
Thus the program has been successfully executed

Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
ðŸ’» Program
a = (0 == True)
b = (False== False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9
print('a is',a)
print('b is',b)
print('c:',c)
print('d:',d)
Output

Result
Thus, the program as been excuted successfully.

Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
ðŸ§¾ Program
v='T'
b='a'
print(v)
print(b)
Output
image

Result
Thus, the program is executed sucessfully.

ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
ðŸ’» Program
x=int(input(''))
y=int(input(''))
x=complex(x,y)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
Output
image

Result
Thus, the program as been executed successfully.

Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

ðŸ§  Algorithm
Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.
ðŸ§¾ Program
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
Output
image

Result
Thus the program is executed successfully
